    question: "Who's behind Trag?",
    answer:
      "Trag is a two-person development team composed of two experienced full-stack developers: Dinesh Tyagi and Pranshu Raj. We work together to design, build, and launch exceptional digital products. Our goal is to serve as your dedicated technical partners, working closely with you to transform your vision into a polished final product."},
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'How does the delivery process work?',
    answer:
      'Our process is collaborative and transparent. Once you submit a request, we begin working on it, providing regular updates in a shared Slack or Whatsapp channel. We work in iterative cycles for both design and development, ensuring your feedback is incorporated at every stage to get the final result just right.',
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    question: 'Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?',
    answer:
      "No, there's no limit! You can add as many requests to your queue as you like—whether for design, development, or both. We process them one at a time to ensure each task gets our full, dedicated attention.",
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    question: 'How fast will I receive my deliverables?',
    answer:
      "Most design and front-end tasks are completed within 48-72 hours. More complex development requests may take longer, but we are committed to constant progress and will always provide clear timelines upfront.",
  },
  {
    id: '5',
    question: "What if I don't like the result?",
    answer:
      "No problem. We offer unlimited iterations. Whether it's a design tweak or a code revision, we'll keep refining the work until it perfectly matches your vision. Your satisfaction is our top priority.",
  },
  {
    id: '6',
    question: 'What kind of projects do you handle?',
    answer:
      "We handle the entire product lifecycle, from initial UI/UX wireframes to fully deployed web applications. This includes front-end (e.g., React, Next.js), back-end (e.g., Node.js), and database management. If you have a digital product idea, we can design and build it.",
  },
  {
    id: '7',
    question: 'How do we communicate and track progress?',
    answer:
      'Communication is direct and simple. You\'ll work with us via a shared Slack channel for real-time updates. We use Trello to manage your project backlog, so you always have full visibility into what’s being worked on and what’s up next.',
  },
  {
    id: '8',
    question: "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer and developer?",
    answer:
      "Hiring for two new roles is a significant investment. With Trag, you gain a dedicated, full-stack development team, immediately available to build your product from concept to code. We provide the efficiency and technical skills you need, without the long-term commitments and overhead of traditional hires.",
  },
  {
    id: '9',
    question: 'Can I get a refund?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. We stand by the quality of our partnership and our work. If you are not satisfied with the service for any reason, we will provide a full refund.',
